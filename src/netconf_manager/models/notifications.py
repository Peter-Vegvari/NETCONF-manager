    The date-and-time type is a profile of the ISO 8601
    standard for representation of dates and times using the
    Gregorian calendar.  The profile is defined by the
    date-time production in Section 5.6 of RFC 3339.

    The date-and-time type is compatible with the dateTime XML
    schema type with the following notable exceptions:

    (a) The date-and-time type does not allow negative years.

    (b) The date-and-time time-offset -00:00 indicates an unknown
        time zone (see RFC 3339) while -00:00 and +00:00 and Z
        all represent the same time zone in dateTime.

    (c) The canonical format (see below) of data-and-time values
        differs from the canonical format used by the dateTime XML
        schema type, which requires all times to be in UTC using
        the time-offset 'Z'.

    This type is not equivalent to the DateAndTime textual
    convention of the SMIv2 since RFC 3339 uses a different
    separator between full-date and full-time and provides
    higher resolution of time-secfrac.

    The canonical format for date-and-time values with a known time
    zone uses a numeric time zone offset that is calculated using
    the device's configured known offset to UTC time.  A change of
    the device's offset to UTC time will cause date-and-time values
    to change accordingly.  Such changes might happen periodically
    in case a server follows automatically daylight saving time
    (DST) time zone offset changes.  The canonical format for
    date-and-time values with an unknown time zone (usually
    referring to the notion of local time) uses the time-offset
    -00:00.

    Initialize an instance of this class and serialize it to JSON; this results in a RESTCONF payload.

    ## Tips
    Initialization:
    - all values have to be set via keyword arguments
    - if a class contains only a `root` field, it can be initialized as follows:
        - `member=MyNode(root=<value>)`
        - `member=<value>`

    Serialziation:
    - `exclude_defaults=True` omits fields set to their default value (recommended)
    - `by_alias=True` ensures qualified names are used (necessary)
